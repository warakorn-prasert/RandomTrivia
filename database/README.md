### Notes
- Category, Question, and GameDetail, each has one primary key.
- GameAnswer uses gameId and questionId as composite key to identify the owner of an answer.
- When a Category is deleted, categoryId in Question and GameAnswer is set to null.
- When a GameDetail is deleted, every associated GameAnswer will be too.
- timestamp in GameDetail is when the game finishes.
- All ids are UUID except Category's, to match category id in opentdb.com.
